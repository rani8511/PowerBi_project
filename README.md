# PowerBi_project
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis and visualization of a Diabetes dataset using Power BI, as part of my learning journey.
It demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and model data to uncover actionable insights through dynamic dashboards.
Tools & Techniques: Power Query for data cleaning and preprocessing
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated columns, measures, and KPIs
Power BI Visualizations for building interactive dashboards
Project Highlights: Data Cleaning in Power Query:
Removed duplicates and nulls
Standardized data formats and column names
Handled missing values and outliers
Created custom columns for enhanced analysis
DAX Measures:
Calculated BMI and cognitive scores
Defined patient categories based on thresholds
Visualizations & Dashboard:
Glucose level and BMI distributions by age and gender, HTN developed after Diabetes, Tobacco and alcoholeffects on the distribution among the patients with Diabetes and control group,
Risk classification by medical features,
Slicers for filtering by demographic and clinical attributes,
Trend charts and data cards for at-a-glance insights,
This project reflects my skills in data preparation, modeling, and visualization using Power BI, with a healthcare focus on understanding and tracking diabetes risk factors.
